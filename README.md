The purpose of the thesis is to study the effectiveness of using genetic
algorithm for solving mathematical equations. Also an additional task is to create a
software product that can be used to solve this problem.
In this work, a software product has been developed in the form of a local web
application that can solve linear and nonlinear mathematical equations with one
solution, conduct research within different algorithm settings. The study of the
effectiveness of using such an approach at different settings of the genetic algorithm
was carried out, a comparison with the analogue on trigonometric, linear, logarithmic
and exponential equations was carried out. As an analogue was chosen sympy - a
library with tools for working with computer algebra which also includes
functionality for solving equations. Detailed results are given below.
The results show that the genetic algorithm can be used for this type of
problems, when high accuracy is not required (within a few hundredths or tenths), but
the performance strongly depends on the initial parameter setting.
